# Shorter Service Stack Overview

## Introduction
The Shorter service stack is a robust system designed to provide URL shortening functionality similar to Bitly. It leverages modern technologies and best practices to ensure scalability, reliability, and performance. This document provides an overview of the components comprising the Shorter service stack, including the backend, API gateway, logging, and visualization tools.

## Components

### 1. Spring Boot Backend
- **Description**: The Spring Boot backend serves as the core of the Shorter service, handling URL shortening requests, redirecting shortened URLs, and managing user authentication and authorization.
- **Key Features**:
    - RESTful API endpoints for URL shortening and redirection.
    - User authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
    - Integration with PostgreSQL database for data persistence.
    - Implementation of URL shortening algorithms.
- **Technologies**: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, PostgreSQL.

### 2. Nginx API Gateway
- **Description**: Nginx functions as the API gateway for the Shorter service, routing incoming requests to the appropriate backend services and providing additional functionality such as rate limiting, load balancing, and SSL termination.
- **Key Features**:
    - Reverse proxy for routing requests to the Spring Boot backend.
    - SSL termination to ensure secure communication between clients and the backend.
    - Rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the service.
- **Technologies**: Nginx, SSL/TLS.

### 3. Logstash for Logging
- **Description**: Logstash is used to collect, process, and transport logs generated by Nginx and the Spring Boot backend to a centralized logging system. It ensures visibility into system behavior, facilitates troubleshooting, and enables monitoring and analysis of logs.
- **Key Features**:
    - Collects access logs and error logs from Nginx and Spring Boot.
    - Parses and enriches log data for easier analysis.
    - Transports logs to Elasticsearch or another log management system for storage and visualization.
- **Technologies**: Logstash, Elasticsearch.

### 4. PostgreSQL Database
- **Description**: PostgreSQL serves as the backend database for storing URL mappings, user information, and other relevant data. It provides ACID compliance, scalability, and reliability for data storage requirements.
- **Key Features**:
    - Stores shortened URLs along with their corresponding long URLs and metadata.
    - Supports concurrent read and write operations.
    - Ensures data integrity and consistency.
- **Technologies**: PostgreSQL, SQL.

### 5. Grafana for Visualization
- **Description**: Grafana is used for monitoring and visualization of system metrics, logs, and performance data. It provides rich visualization capabilities, dashboards, and alerting features for gaining insights into system behavior and performance.
- **Key Features**:
    - Creates dashboards to monitor system metrics, such as request rate, latency, and error rates.
    - Integrates with Elasticsearch or other data sources to visualize log data.
    - Sets up alerts and notifications based on predefined thresholds.
- **Technologies**: Grafana, Elasticsearch.

## Conclusion
The Shorter service stack combines the power of Spring Boot, Nginx, Logstash, PostgreSQL, and Grafana to deliver a robust and scalable URL shortening solution. By leveraging these technologies, the stack ensures high performance, reliability, and observability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications and use cases.
